# LendingClub Analysis: Insights from Issued Loans

This is a shiny app I built to display analyzed data from LendingClub's issued loans.

The link to the live shiny app is [here](https://tlk27.shinyapps.io/lending/). 
Furthermore, the narrative for the app can be found on my blog [here](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/lendingclub-analysis-insights-from-issued-loans/).
The narrative provides important context for the analysis in the shiny app.

# The App
- To utilize the app locally, clone the repository
- Open one of the scripts using R Studio

# The Analysis
Insights derived from the issued loans were based on a sample of 500,000 records from the data.
Analysis included: 
- Examining loans by state
- Loan purposes
- Loan grades
- Loan statuses
- Funding and payment comparison
